## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

  * Node.js (v18.x or later)
  * npm
  * Git

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Jalpan04/vinylogue-project.git
    cd vinylogue-project
    ```

2.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**

    ```sh
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**

    ```sh
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    You will need to create two environment files. Use the `.env.example` files in each directory as a template.

      * In the `/backend` directory, create a `.env` file:

        ```env
        MONGO_URI=YOUR_MONGODB_ATLAS_CONNECTION_STRING
        PORT=5001
        JWT_SECRET=YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_JWT_KEY
        SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID
        SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET
        ```

      * In the `/frontend` directory, create a `.env.local` file:

        ```env
        VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5001
        ```

5.  **Run the Application:**
    You will need to run the backend and frontend servers in two separate terminals.

      * To start the backend server (from the `/backend` directory):
        ```sh
        npm start
        ```
      * To start the frontend development server (from the `/frontend` directory):
        ```sh
        npm run dev
        ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000) (or the port specified by Vite) to view the app in your browser.
